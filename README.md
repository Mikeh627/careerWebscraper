# Webscraper for CNT 4104
This program is a webscraper to pull information off of certain websites and acculmate the data on our own. This project has and will been written in Python.
This project is created by Bailey Lewis, Michael Householder, and Joshua Cowan.


The purpose of this application is to fetch the latest data from an online source (i.e. LinkdIn, etc.), and input it into a database that will hold general information. 
Such as name of the company, pay or salary, position title, and the location of job. 

Currently we have the application fetching data and writing to a simple .txt file, however our next steps are to improve upon the already created 'webscraper' and create 
the addition of DB integration to our project. We hope to eventually display this information to a free-use website for students in the area or even students around the
country to use as a simple job board with all the basic information they need.
