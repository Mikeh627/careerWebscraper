# Webscraper for CNT 4104
This program is a webscraper to pull information off of certain websites and acculmate the data on our own. This project has and will be written in Python.
This project is created by Bailey Lewis, Michael Householder, and Joshua Cowan.

The purpose of this application is to fetch the latest data from an online source (i.e. LinkdIn, etc.), and input it into a database that will hold general information. 
Such as name of the company, pay or salary, position title, and the location of job. 

Currently we have the application fetching data from linkedIn and writing to a .txt file and database. We hope to eventually display this information to a free-use website for students in the area or even students around the country to use as a simple job board with all the basic information they need. 

How to use application:

1) open the file in IDE of your choice
2) run the prgram and enter the query questions in the console
3) wait for the program to fetch data
4) view your data!

This is a very early prototype, only fetching 25 jobs at the moment, we hope to expand and make the data 'prettier' if you will.
